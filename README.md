# YOLO-V5_Object_Detction

YOLOv5 ðŸš€ is a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, and represents Ultralytics open-source research into future vision AI methods, incorporating lessons learned and best practices evolved over thousands of hours of research and development.

Here, we will use Google Drive and Google Colab to train the model.

**Used a dataset which is already annotated and with two class that is Electric Car and Electric Bus. Got the dataset from kaggle.
