# YOLO-V5_Object_Detction

YOLOv5 ðŸš€ is a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, and represents Ultralytics open-source research into future vision AI methods, incorporating lessons learned and best practices evolved over thousands of hours of research and development.

**YOLO-V5 : Git Repo - https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5**

**Used a dataset which is already annotated and with two class that is Electric Car and Electric Bus. Got the dataset from kaggle.**
