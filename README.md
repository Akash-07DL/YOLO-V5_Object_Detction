# YOLO-V5_Object_Detction (Custom Data)

YOLOv5 ðŸš€ is a family of object detection architectures and models pretrained on the COCO dataset, and represents Ultralytics open-source research into future vision AI methods, incorporating lessons learned and best practices evolved over thousands of hours of research and development.

**YOLO-V5 : Git Repo - https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5**

**Used a dataset which is already annotated and with two class that is Electric Car and Electric Bus. Got the dataset from kaggle.**

# Data Annotation :
We can do the data annotation from RoboloFlow as per our Requirement. RoboFlow provide many things like data annotation, data preparation, data augmentation, file converter etc.

# Training :

**Here, we will use Google Drive and Google Colab to train the model.**
 
 **MODEL**
 There are several models in YOLO-V5, a glimpse into that.
